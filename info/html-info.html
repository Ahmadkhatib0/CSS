  <img srcset=" img/logo-green-1x.png 1x ,  img/logo-green-2x.png 2x">
  So now this source set attribute here allows the browser to choose the best of these two images here,
  , according to the screen that is used by the user to display the webpage. so 1x is for low
  resolution screens while 2x is for the higher ones So this is density switching in HTML


  <picture class="footer__logo">
    <source srcset="img/logo-green-small-1x.png 1x , img/logo-green-small-2x.png 2x " media="(max-width:37.5em)">
    <img srcset=" img/logo-green-1x.png 1x ,  img/logo-green-2x.png 2x" alt="">
  </picture>
  the picture element in which we can basically specify multiple sources for one image
  so here we force the browser if it was on 600px or under to choose 1x if it was low screen
  or 2x if it was high resolution screen , and than in img after that for the other breakpoints
  so if it was on above 600px to choose 1x if it was low screen
  or 2x if it was high resolution screen So that is called art direction, Different images for different viewport width,



  <img srcset="img/nat-3.jpg 300w, img/nat-3-large.jpg 1000w" alt=""
    sizes="(max-width:900px) 20vw , (max-width:600px) 30vw , 300px" class="composition__photo composition__photo--p3"
    src="img/nat-3-large.jpg">
  first: src will be executed if the browser didn't understand what are srcset and sizes and alt
  all about ,, So this entire thing here will take care of actually both resolution switching
  Because we gave the browser enough information to figure out exactly what to do
  depending on both the view port width and the pixel density, so the screen resolution.
  the third argument of the sizes is the default size
